Add IOS App to firebase (give some uniuqe name)
Download the .plist file and copy & add it to the project near the info.plist

Setup Cocoapods:
  pod init
  add these lines to the podfile
   pod 'Firebase'
   pod 'Firebase/Core'
   pod 'Firebase/Database'
   pod 'Firebase/Auth'
  run 'pod install'
  
 Register Firebase with the App
 Add these lines to the main Appdelegate file
 import Firebase
 Firebase.configure()    (Override inside the main function before returning)
 
 
 You can check the connection visa 

 let db=Database.databse().reference
 db.setValue("Welcome to Firebase")
 
 If app does not store value in the Firebase database, you may need to set the permission. 
 Go to the Firebase console, open database tab and go to rules and make sure both read and write are set true (beware anyone can read and write if set true and not configured properly)
