Conda needs to installed from Installer and not pip if needed to use from comand line. 
Either Install Annaconda or Miniconda. If one is installed, other needs to be uninstalled first which can be done by (rm -r miniconda3)

After installing from Installer it will be needed to add the path to system:
-> Open 'nano .profile' or 'nano .bashrc' or 'open ~/.bash_profile'
-> Add the path to miniconda or anaconda i.e "export PATH=/Users/zeeshannawaz/.annaconda/bin/:$PATH"

Now 'conda' will be recognised as command in the cmd

Now create a virtual environment using conda i.e 
'conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5' (name 'tensorflow' can be changed)
It may need to close the cmd after it
'source activate tensorflow'  Activate the VE by 
'conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow'
'conda install notebook ipykernel' Install notebook using Conda
'jupyter notebook' Open notebook and play with tensorflow
